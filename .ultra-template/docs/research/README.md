# Research Reports

This directory contains research reports generated by `/ultra-research` command.

## Structure

Each round generates a report with quality metadata:

| Round | Report File |
|-------|-------------|
| 1: User & Scenario | `user-scenario-{date}.md` |
| 2: Feature Definition | `feature-definition-{date}.md` |
| 3: Architecture Design | `architecture-design-{date}.md` |
| 4: Quality & Deployment | `quality-deployment-{date}.md` |

## Report Format

Each report includes quality tracking in header:

```markdown
# Round {N}: {Round Name}

> **Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
> **Confidence**: 92%
> **Iterations**: 1
> **Completed**: {date}

## Summary
...
```

## Quality Gate

- Rating <4 stars → Round iterates until quality met
- Each round must achieve ≥4 stars to continue
- No separate "overall gate" - completing all rounds guarantees quality

## Integration

- Reports are referenced in `specs/` for technology decisions
- Quality summary displayed at end of `/ultra-research`
