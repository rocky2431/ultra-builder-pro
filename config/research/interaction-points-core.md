# Core Interactive Questions - Hybrid Model

**Purpose**: High-frequency standardized questions that ensure consistency across 80%+ projects.

**Design Principle**: "Standardize the Core, Liberate the Extension"
- Core questions (this file): Standardized for consistency
- Extension questions (dynamically generated by Claude): Context-adaptive for flexibility

**Language Protocol**: Questions in English for system; runtime output in Chinese.

## Usage Notes

**For Claude**:

1. **Load core questions** from this file when executing ultra-research Round 1-4 Step 1
2. **Generate 1-2 extension questions** dynamically based on project context
3. **Extension question guidelines**:
   - Analyze user's initial description for domain-specific keywords
   - Generate questions specific to detected context (e.g., healthcare → HIPAA compliance)
   - Ensure 2-4 options per question
   - Keep header ≤12 characters
   - Validate format before calling AskUserQuestion tool

**Token Cost**: ~260 tokens (vs 1,040 tokens for full interaction-points.md)

**Coverage**: 13 core questions cover 80-85% of common scenarios. Extension questions cover remaining 15-20%.
